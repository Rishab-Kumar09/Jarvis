- üó£Ô∏è **Natural Speech**: Responds with human-like speech using ElevenLabs' text-to-speech
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Responses**: Uses GPT-4 for intelligent conversation and task handling
- üìù **Note Taking**: Can create, append to, and manage notes in Notepad
- üåê **Web Search**: Performs web searches directly through voice commands
- üíª **Application Control**: Opens and closes applications with voice commands
- ‚ö° **System Commands**: Executes system commands and provides system information
- üå§Ô∏è **Weather Information**: Provides weather updates for any city
- ‚è∞ **Time Information**: Tells the current time
- üéØ **Interruption Handling**: Can be interrupted mid-speech with "stop" command
- üì± **Remote Control**: Control JARVIS from your phone or any device through a web interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Windows OS (some features are Windows-specific)
- Required API keys (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, OpenWeather)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis.git
   cd jarvis
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
   - Fill in your API keys in the `.env` file

## Usage

### Voice Control
Run JARVIS with voice control:
```bash
python jarvis.py
```

### Remote Control
Run JARVIS with web interface for remote control:
```bash
python web_interface.py
```
Then open `http://your_computer_ip:5000` in your phone's browser to access the remote control interface.

### Example Commands

- "Open Chrome"
- "Close Notepad"
- "Write a shopping list in Notepad"
- "Search for latest tech news"
- "What's the weather in London?"
- "What time is it?"
- "Stop" (interrupts current speech)

All these commands work both through voice and the remote web interface.

## Configuration

JARVIS can be configured through environment variables in the `.env` file:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: Your ElevenLabs API key
- `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`: Your ElevenLabs voice ID
- `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`: Your OpenWeather API key (optional)

## Remote Control Interface

The web interface provides:
- Text input for sending any command to JARVIS
- Quick action buttons for common commands
- Real-time response display
- Mobile-friendly design
- Works on any device with a web browser

To use the remote control:
1. Run `python web_interface.py` on your computer
2. Find your computer's IP address (use `ipconfig` on Windows)
3. On your phone, open a browser and go to `http://your_computer_ip:5000`
4. Enter commands or use quick action buttons to control JARVIS
